# crix-todo 🦀✅
### *Version 1.0.0 – Saracen*

A terminal-based task manager written in Rust — redesigned from the ground up for speed, simplicity, and focus.  
No more cluttered commands. Just one clean, unified experience.

---

## ⚙️ Overview

`crix-todo` now runs entirely from a single command:

```
todo
```

This launches the interactive TUI, where you can **add**, **edit**, **delete**, **split**, and **reorganize** your todos in one streamlined interface.  
The philosophy: *minimal UI, maximal control.*

---

## 📦 Installation

```
cargo install crix-todo
```

---

## 🚀 Highlights

- 🧭 **Single Command Workflow** – Launch everything with just `todo`.
- ➕ **Add Inline** – Press `=` inside the TUI to instantly create a new task.
- ✏️ **Inline Editing** – Edit title or notes directly without leaving the view.
- 🔁 **Undo Support** – Quickly recover from mistakes with `u`.
- 🪶 **Simplified Metadata** – No tags, no due dates, no “done” status. Just titles, priorities, and notes.
- 🌳 **Modern Tree-Style Layout** – Todos and notes are rendered in a clear, visual hierarchy.
- 🧩 **Split Tasks** – Break large todos into smaller parts with a single keypress.
- ⚡ **Instant State Persistence** – All changes are saved immediately to your local JSON store.
