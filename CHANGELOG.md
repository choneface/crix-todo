### Saracen (Major Release)

‚ÄúClear eyes. Full hearts. No distractions.‚Äù

Version **1.0.0 (Saracen)** marks the first major release of `crix-todo`.  
This release is a full redesign focused on simplicity, speed, and focus.

#### Added
- Unified single-command workflow: launch everything with `todo`
- Inline todo creation (`=`) directly within the TUI
- Inline editing for titles and notes (`i`)
- Undo functionality (`u`) to revert the last action
- Tree-style visual layout for todos and notes
- Local JSON storage with instant persistence
- Task splitting (`b`) for dividing long tasks

#### Changed
- Removed `add` and `list` CLI subcommands ‚Äî replaced with a unified TUI
- Removed ‚Äúdone‚Äù state; completed todos are now deleted
- Removed due dates, tags, and extra metadata for a leaner UX
- Simplified file structure and startup behavior
- Redesigned TUI layout with modern borders and indentation

#### Keybindings
| Key | Action |
|-----|---------|
| **j / k** | Move selection |
| **Space** | Expand or collapse todo |
| **i** | Edit (title or notes) |
| **=** | Add a new todo |
| **‚å´ (Backspace)** | Delete selected todo |
| **p / l** | Toggle priority |
| **b** | Split todo into part 1 and part 2 |
| **u** | Undo last action |
| **Esc** | Quit TUI |

#### üí° Philosophy
The Saracen release embodies clarity and decisiveness.  
No menus, no clutter ‚Äî just a direct connection between your keyboard and your focus.  
It‚Äôs the purest form of task management: minimal UI, maximal control.
